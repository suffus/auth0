I wish you to develop a REST API in Go that will support authentication and authorization for various applications including:
    - Web applications 
    - Mobile applications
    - Desktop applications
    - IoT devices
    - API services
    - Microservices
    - Batch jobs
    - Scheduled tasks
    - etc.

The application should be able to support the following authentication methods:
    - Yubikey OTP (OTP is generated by Yubikey)
    - Authentication codes generated by authentication apps such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, etc.
    - SMS OTP
    - Email OTP
    - etc.

The application should be able to support the following authorization methods:
    - Role-based access control (RBAC)
    - Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
    - etc.

The application should be able to support the following features:
    - Multi-factor authentication
    - Single sign-on (SSO)
    - etc.

The REST API should have and endpoint for each authentication method.  

The application should have database for storing users, roles, permissions, authentication devices (such as yubikeys or authentication apps), authentication history, etc.

The application should have a web interface for managing users, roles, permissions, authentication devices, authentication history, etc.

The application should have a REST API for authenticating users by their authentication devices, managing users, roles, permissions, authentication devices, authentication history, etc.
