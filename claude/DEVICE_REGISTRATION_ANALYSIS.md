# Device Registration System Analysis & Implementation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the device registration system implemented for YubiApp, which allows authorized users to register, deregister, and transfer devices between users with full audit trail capabilities.

## Requirements Analysis

### Core Requirements
1. **Device Registration**: Allow one user to register a device to another user
2. **Device Deregistration**: Allow removal of devices from users (for various reasons)
3. **Device Transfer**: Allow moving devices between users
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of who performed what action when
5. **Permission-Based Access**: Only authorized users can perform these operations

### Business Scenarios
- **User Onboarding**: Admin registers YubiKey to new employee
- **User Departure**: Admin deregisters device when user leaves
- **Device Replacement**: Transfer old device to new user or deregister lost device
- **Device Reassignment**: Move device from one user to another
- **Compliance**: Track all device lifecycle events for audit purposes

## Technical Design

### Database Schema

#### DeviceRegistration Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE device_registrations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    
    registrar_user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    device_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES devices(id),
    target_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id), -- NULL for deregistration
    
    action_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (action_type IN ('register', 'deregister')),
    reason TEXT,
    ip_address VARCHAR(45),
    user_agent TEXT,
    notes TEXT
);
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Single Table**: All registration events (register, deregister, transfer) use the same table
- **Nullable Target User**: `target_user_id` is NULL for deregistration events
- **Action Type**: Distinguishes between register and deregister operations
- **Audit Fields**: IP address, user agent, and notes for complete traceability

### Permission System

#### Required Permissions
1. **`yubiapp:register-other`** - Permission to register devices to other users
2. **`yubiapp:deregister-other`** - Permission to deregister devices from other users

#### Transfer Logic
- **Transfer = Deregister + Register**: No separate transfer permission
- **Dual Permission Requirement**: Transfer requires both `register-other` AND `deregister-other`
- **Security Benefit**: More restrictive than individual operations

### API Design

#### Endpoints
1. **POST** `/api/v1/devices/register` - Register device to user
2. **POST** `/api/v1/devices/{device_id}/deregister` - Deregister device from user
3. **POST** `/api/v1/devices/{device_id}/transfer` - Transfer device between users
4. **GET** `/api/v1/devices/{device_id}/history` - View device registration history

**Note on HTTP Methods:**
- **POST for Deregister**: Uses POST instead of DELETE to comply with OpenAPI specification, as DELETE operations should not have request bodies
- **Consistent POST Operations**: All modification operations (register, deregister, transfer) use POST for consistency

#### Authentication
- **Device-Based**: Uses YubiKey OTP in Authorization header
- **Permission Checks**: Validates required permissions before operation
- **User Context**: Extracts registrar information from authenticated device

#### Request/Response Patterns
- **Consistent Structure**: All endpoints follow similar request/response patterns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Audit Information**: Responses include registrar and operation details

## Implementation Details

### Service Layer Architecture

#### DeviceRegistrationService
```go
type DeviceRegistrationService struct {
    db *gorm.DB
}

// Core operations
func (s *DeviceRegistrationService) RegisterDevice(...) (*DeviceRegistration, error)
func (s *DeviceRegistrationService) DeregisterDevice(...) (*DeviceRegistration, error)
func (s *DeviceRegistrationService) TransferDevice(...) (*DeviceRegistration, error)
func (s *DeviceRegistrationService) GetDeviceHistory(...) ([]DeviceRegistration, error)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Transactional Operations**: All operations use database transactions
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input and business rule validation
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages for debugging
- **Audit Logging**: Automatic creation of registration records

### Business Logic

#### Registration Process
1. **Authenticate Registrar**: Verify YubiKey OTP and check permissions
2. **Validate Target User**: Ensure target user exists and is active
3. **Device Handling**: Find existing device or create new one
4. **Ownership Transfer**: Update device ownership
5. **Audit Logging**: Create registration record

#### Deregistration Process
1. **Authenticate Registrar**: Verify YubiKey OTP and check permissions
2. **Validate Device**: Ensure device exists and is currently registered
3. **Ownership Removal**: Set device user_id to NULL and mark inactive
4. **Audit Logging**: Create deregistration record with reason

#### Transfer Process
1. **Authenticate Registrar**: Verify YubiKey OTP and check BOTH permissions
2. **Validate Operation**: Ensure device is registered and target user is valid
3. **Transactional Transfer**: Deregister from current user, register to new user
4. **Dual Audit Logging**: Create both deregistration and registration records

### CLI Integration

#### Commands Added
```bash
# Register device
./yubiapp device register --registrar-device-code="otp" --target-user="email" --device-identifier="id" --device-type="yubikey"

# Deregister device
./yubiapp device deregister --registrar-device-code="otp" --device-id="uuid" --reason="user_left"

# Transfer device
./yubiapp device transfer --registrar-device-code="otp" --device-id="uuid" --target-user="email"

# View history
./yubiapp device history --device-id="uuid"
```

**Features:**
- **Permission Validation**: CLI validates permissions before operations
- **User-Friendly**: Accepts email addresses for user identification
- **Comprehensive Output**: Detailed success/failure information
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## Security Considerations

### Permission Model
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only get permissions they need
- **Separation of Concerns**: Register and deregister are separate permissions
- **Transfer Restriction**: Transfer requires both permissions, making it more secure

### Authentication
- **Device-Based**: Uses existing YubiKey authentication system
- **Permission Validation**: Checks specific permissions for each operation
- **User Context**: All operations are tied to authenticated registrar

### Data Integrity
- **Transactional Operations**: All operations are atomic
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input and business rule validation
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all operations

## Error Handling

### HTTP Status Codes
- **200**: Success
- **400**: Bad Request (invalid input)
- **401**: Unauthorized (authentication failed)
- **403**: Forbidden (permission denied)
- **404**: Not Found (user/device not found)
- **409**: Conflict (device already registered, etc.)

### Error Scenarios
- **Device Already Registered**: 409 Conflict
- **Device Not Registered**: 409 Conflict (for deregister/transfer)
- **User Not Found**: 404 Not Found
- **User Inactive**: 400 Bad Request
- **Invalid Reason**: 400 Bad Request
- **Permission Denied**: 403 Forbidden

## API Compliance

### OpenAPI Specification Compliance
- **POST for Deregister**: Uses POST instead of DELETE to comply with OpenAPI spec
- **Request Bodies**: All modification operations include request bodies for data
- **Consistent Patterns**: All endpoints follow consistent request/response patterns
- **Proper Documentation**: Complete OpenAPI documentation with examples

### RESTful Design Considerations
- **Resource-Oriented**: Endpoints represent device registration resources
