# Unified Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the improved session management approach that uses unified endpoints instead of duplicate session-specific endpoints. This provides a much cleaner, more RESTful API design.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Unified Authentication Middleware** (`internal/server/middleware.go`)

**New Functions:**
- `authMiddlewareRead()` - Accepts both device and session authentication for GET methods
- `authMiddlewareWrite()` - Accepts only device authentication for POST/PUT/DELETE methods
- `authMiddleware()` - Legacy wrapper for backward compatibility

**Features:**
- Automatic detection of Bearer tokens vs device auth
- HTTP method-based restrictions (session auth only for reads)
- Proper error messages for unauthorized auth methods
- Session state validation and access count tracking

### 2. **Updated Router** (`internal/server/router.go`)

**Changes:**
- Removed all duplicate `/session/*` endpoints
- Updated all existing endpoints to use appropriate middleware:
  - GET methods: `authMiddlewareRead()` (both auth methods)
  - POST/PUT/DELETE methods: `authMiddlewareWrite()` (device auth only)
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing device authentication

### 3. **Updated OpenAPI Specification** (`openapi.yaml`)

**Changes:**
- Removed all duplicate session endpoints
- Updated existing endpoints to show dual authentication support
- Added clear documentation about auth method restrictions
- Enhanced security scheme descriptions

### 4. **Enhanced Test Script** (`test_session.sh`)

**New Tests:**
- Tests unified endpoints instead of separate session endpoints
- Verifies session tokens work for read operations
- Verifies session tokens are rejected for write operations
- Confirms device authentication still works for all operations

### 5. **Updated Documentation** (`SESSION_README.md`)

**New Content:**
- Comprehensive explanation of unified authentication
- Clear examples of both auth methods
- HTTP method-based restrictions documentation
- Advantages of the unified approach

## API Behavior

### Read Operations (GET methods)
```bash
# Both of these work:
GET /api/v1/users
Authorization: yubikey:<otp>

GET /api/v1/users  
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

### Write Operations (POST, PUT, DELETE methods)
```bash
# This works:
POST /api/v1/users
Authorization: yubikey:<otp>

# This fails with 403:
POST /api/v1/users
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

## Security Features

1. **HTTP Method Restrictions**: Session tokens only work for read operations
2. **Token Reuse Prevention**: Access count validation prevents token reuse
3. **Short-lived Tokens**: 15-minute access token expiry
4. **Single-use Refresh**: Refresh tokens can only be used once
5. **Clear Error Messages**: Proper 403 responses for unauthorized auth methods

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ **API Design Excellence**
- Single source of truth for each resource
- RESTful compliance
- No duplicate endpoint definitions
- Cleaner OpenAPI documentation

### ✅ **Developer Experience**
- Intuitive endpoint structure
- Consistent authentication patterns
- Clear error messages
- Backward compatibility maintained

### ✅ **Maintenance Benefits**
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier testing (one endpoint, multiple auth methods)
- Future-proof for new auth methods
- Simplified router configuration

### ✅ **Security Clarity**
- Explicit permission boundaries
- Clear audit trails
- Proper separation of concerns

## Files Modified

1. `internal/server/middleware.go` - New unified authentication middleware
2. `internal/server/router.go` - Updated to use unified endpoints
3. `internal/server/handlers_sessions.go` - **DELETED** (no longer needed)
4. `openapi.yaml` - Removed duplicate endpoints, updated existing ones
5. `test_session.sh` - Updated to test unified approach
6. `SESSION_README.md` - Comprehensive documentation update
7. `UNIFIED_AUTH_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive testing:
- Session creation and refresh
- Unified endpoint access with both auth methods
- Write operation restrictions
- Token invalidation
- Device authentication compatibility

Run tests with: `./test_session.sh`

## Conclusion

The unified authentication approach successfully transforms the API from having duplicate endpoints to having a clean, RESTful design that's both more intuitive and more maintainable. The implementation maintains all security features while providing a significantly better developer experience.
